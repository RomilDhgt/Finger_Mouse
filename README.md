The code captures video from the laptop's camera, detects hands using a hand tracking module, and allows you to perform hand gestures to control the mouse. It overlays a hand mesh on the captured image, tracks the position of specific fingers, and interprets finger movements to control the mouse pointer. Additionally, it includes features such as clicking and scrolling based on finger gestures. The code continuously displays the camera feed with real-time hand tracking information and frames per second (FPS) on the screen.
